                    <p>"3 Idiots" is a 2009 Indian comedy-drama film directed by Rajkumar Hirani, which follows the lives of three engineering students—Rancho, Farhan, and Raju—at a prestigious college. 
                        The film critiques the rigid and pressure-filled education system in India, focusing on the societal expectations that often force students to follow conventional paths rather than pursue their passions. 
                        The story alternates between the past and present, as the characters reunite years later to search for their missing friend, Rancho, who had always questioned the traditional approach to education. 
                        The major cast includes Aamir Khan as Rancho, R. Madhavan as Farhan, Sharman Joshi as Raju, Kareena Kapoor as Pia, and Boman Irani as the strict college director Viru Sahastrabuddhe. 
                        "3 Idiots" became a massive box office success, grossing over ₹392 crore worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its entertaining narrative, powerful performances, and its social commentary on the flaws of the education system.
                        It inspired a generation to follow their true passions, and its famous catchphrase, "All is well," became a symbol of optimism, making the film a cultural phenomenon that left a lasting impact on both Indian cinema and society.
