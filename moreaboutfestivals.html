                    <p> Durga Puja is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrated with grandeur, primarily in West Bengal and other parts of India. 
                        It honors Goddess Durga's triumph over the demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the victory of good over evil. 
                        Traditional rituals involve the setting up of elaborately decorated pandals (temporary structures) housing clay idols 
                        of the goddess and her family, accompanied by daily prayers and cultural performances.

                        vegetables, and sweets), luchi (fried flatbread), and sweets such as sandesh and rasgulla being savored by devotees. 
                        The festival concludes with the immersion of the idols in water, signifying Durga's return to her celestial abode, 
                        leaving behind a spirit of unity and joy.
